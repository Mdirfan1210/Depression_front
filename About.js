        <p>Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest in things and activities you once enjoyed. 
          It can also cause difficulty with thinking, memory, eating and sleeping.<br></br>

It’s normal to feel sad about or grieve over difficult life situations, such as losing your job or a divorce. 
But depression is different in that it persists practically every day for at least two weeks and involves other symptoms than sadness alone.
<br></br>
There are several types of depressive disorders. Clinical depression, or major depressive disorder, is often just called “depression.” 
It’s the most severe type of depression.
<br></br>
Without treatment, depression can get worse and last longer. In severe cases, it can lead to self-harm or death by suicide. The good news is that treatments can be very effective in improving symptoms.
